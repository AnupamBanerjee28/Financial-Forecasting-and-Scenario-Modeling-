# Financial-Forecasting-and-Scenario-Modeling

## **Overview**

This project involves the development of a fully integrated 3-Statement Financial Model (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement) to forecast a company's financial performance over a multi-year period. The primary goal was to create a dynamic model capable of testing various business assumptions and performing sensitivity analysis to assess risk and potential returns.
The analysis leveraged real-world financial data, including historical Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements, to establish data-driven forecasting drivers.

---------

## **Key Features & Results**

**•	Integrated 3-Statement Model:** Developed a robust, linked financial model ensuring accounting consistency (Net Income flows to Balance Sheet/Cash Flow).

**•	Driver-Based Forecasting:** Generated future projections (Revenue, COGS, OpEx) based on clearly defined, adjustable drivers (e.g., Revenue Growth %, COGS % of Revenue).

**•	Sensitivity Analysis:** Implemented "What-If" analysis (as seen in Forecasting_Workbook.xlsx - Outputs.csv) to calculate the impact of changing key variables (e.g., Revenue Growth and COGS percentages) on the projected Net Income.

**•	Goal Seek/Targeting:** Demonstrated the ability to determine the necessary input (e.g., required Revenue) to achieve a specific financial target (e.g., target Net Income).

**•	Data Visualization:** Outputted chart data (Bar Chart for Expense Breakd.csv) to visualize historical and projected financial components.

---------

## **Skills Demonstrated**

**•	Financial Analysis:** Analyzing historical trends, ratio analysis, and establishing accurate forecasting drivers.

**•	Quantitative Analysis:** Sensitivity testing, scenario planning, and target-seeking (Goal Seek).

**•	Data Processing:** Data cleaning, ingestion, and structuring of complex financial datasets.

---------

## **Tools and Technologies Used**

**Excel / CSV data** – Used as the primary environment for model development and for setting key assumptions.

**MS Excel** – Used for cleaning, organizing, and preparing historical data through functions, filters, tables, and basic transformation tools.

**Sensitivity tables** – Enable systematic testing of how different input variables affect model outputs.

**Data visualization tools** – Produce clear charts and summaries for communicating findings to stakeholders.

**Integrated workflow** – Combines data sourcing, processing, analysis, and visualization to deliver a complete modeling process.

---------

## **Methodology**

**1.	Data Ingestion:** Loaded historical financial data (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) from provided CSV files.

**2.	Assumption Setting:** Established a dedicated set of input assumptions (growth rates, margins, tax rates).

**3.	Model Build:** Constructed the 3-statement model, linking all projected lines items to ensure mathematical and accounting accuracy.

**4.	Scenario Testing:** Used the model's dynamic structure to test outcomes across various growth/cost scenarios.

**5.	Reporting:** Generated structured outputs, including scenario tables and visualizations, to present findings clearly.
